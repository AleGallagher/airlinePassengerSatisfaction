#  Passengers Satisfaction

An Airline wants to know and predict the satisfaction of their clients.For that, they have given to me a data set that contains a number of surveys about the satisfaction of the airline's passengers. The aim is to predict the passenger satisfaction, if it will be "satisfied" or, "neutral or dissatisfied", and find out what are the most important features for the clients. Considering the target, we are in front of a binary classification problem.
